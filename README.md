# Customer Segmentation using K-Means Clustering

This project demonstrates the use of K-Means Clustering for customer segmentation. The goal of this project is to group customers into distinct segments based on their purchasing behavior, using features such as spending score, income, and other customer-related variables. This helps businesses understand their customers better and can be used for targeted marketing strategies, improving customer service, and optimizing products or services for different customer groups.

## Project Overview

In this project, we used K-Means Clustering, an unsupervised learning algorithm, to cluster customers into different segments. By analyzing customer data, we identified distinct customer groups based on similarities in purchasing behavior and demographic data.

## Dataset

The dataset used for this project is a Customer Data which includes features like:
- Spending score.
- Annual Income: The income of the customer.
